        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, fellow wizards and Muggles!
          <strong>I'm Harry James Potter</strong>, <em>the Boy Who Lived</em>. I
          was born on July 31, 1980, and my life has been nothing short of
          magical ever since.

      <section id="my-journey">
        <h2>My Journey at Hogwarts</h2>
        <p>
          I was sorted into Gryffindor House, known for its bravery and
          chivalry. Throughout my years at Hogwarts, I faced various challenges
          and made lifelong friends. From the Philosopher's Stone to the Deathly
          Hallows, my journey was filled with magical encounters, dark secrets,
          and the power of friendship. Gryffindor House became my second home. I
          shared a dormitory with Ron Weasley, my best mate, and other
          Gryffindor students. Together, we faced the wonders of magical
          education, from the Sorting Hat's song to the excitement of Quidditch
          matches. Hogwarts wouldn't be the same without a bit of mischief!
          Alongside Fred and George Weasley, we pulled off some legendary
          pranks. From the Marauder's Map to extendable ears, laughter echoed
          through the hallways. And who could forget the time we turned the
          Slytherin common room into a swamp?
